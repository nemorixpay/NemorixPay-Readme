## Subsection: MSB (Money Services Business)

## 📘 MSB Registration Overview

### What is an MSB?
A **Money Services Business (MSB)** is a business that provides services such as money transmission or virtual currency value transfer. Under the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (*31 C.F.R. § 1010.100(ff)*), **platforms like NemorixPay that transmit digital currencies (e.g., XLM, USDC) qualify as MSBs** and must be registered with [FinCEN](https://bsaefiling.fincen.gov/) (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network).

### Who Administers MSB Registration?
The **Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)**, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, is responsible for each MSB’s **Registration of Money Services Business (Form 107)**, which must be filed via FinCEN’s **BSA E-Filing System** within 180 days of establishment, details [here](https://www.fincen.gov/money-services-business-msb-registration).

### 🛠 Registration Steps (FinCEN Form 107)
1. **Enroll in BSA E‑Filing** as an “Institution” ([bsaefiling.fincen.treas.gov](https://bsaefiling.fincen.treas.gov) )
2. **Open and complete RMSB (FinCEN Form 107)**:
   - Provide legal entity data, ownership, EIN, address, etc.
   - Indicate MSB activity as “Money Transmitter”
   - List agents (if applicable), primary transaction account, and transaction volume estimates.
3. **Sign digitally with your PIN**, save a PDF copy, and submit. 
4. **Receive Submission Confirmation** and a tracking ID. In ~2 business days you’ll get a BSA ID via the Secure Messaging inbox, and registration appears on FinCEN’s public MSB registry within ~2 weeks.

### ✅ Why NemorixPay Should Register as an MSB

- **Federal requirement**: Recognized digital-asset transmission qualifies as “money services,” triggering the MSB rule.
- **Compliance readiness**: Registration affirms an AML/KYC compliance framework, enabling access to regulated partners like Bitso.
- **Regulatory trust**: MSB status signals credibility to banks, regulators, and users.

### ⚙️ Post-Registration Obligations & Benefits

- **Compliance program**: Must implement written AML/KYC policies, training, and independent audits.  
- **Reporting**: File periodic CTR (Currency Transaction Reports) and SAR (Suspicious Activity Reports) via BSA E-Filing
- **Agent list maintenance**: If relevant, update annually (by Jan 1) and retain for five years
- **Record retention**: Keep registration documents, agent data, transaction volume estimates, and ownership information for a minimum of five years
- **Renewal**: Submit a new Form 107 every two years by December 31 (check *1b Renewal*)
