## Subsection: Basic roadmap for Implementing QA in NemorixPay

A basic & structured Testing & QA roadmap ensures high-quality, secure, and reliable mobile & web applications. Here’s a step-by-step plan tailored for NemorixPay:

### 📌 Phase 1: Define QA Strategy

🔹 **Objective**: Establish a solid QA foundation before development scales.

✅ **Actions**:

* Define testing types needed (functional, performance, security, etc.).
* Choose a test automation strategy (which tests to automate vs. manual testing).
* Set up a device testing plan (real devices + emulators/simulators).
* Identify key QA tools (Appium, Flutter Driver, Firebase, etc.).

### 📌 Phase 2: Implement Unit & Integration Testing (During Development)

🔹 **Objective**: Ensure stable core functionalities before adding more features.

✅ **Actions**:

* Write unit tests for critical business logic.
* Implement integration tests (API calls, database transactions).
* Set up mocking for dependencies (e.g., mock API responses).
* Use CI/CD pipelines to automate tests (GitHub Actions, Bitrise).

📌 **Tools**:

* Flutter Test, Mockito (for unit tests).
* Postman, Insomnia (for API testing).
* GitHub Actions, Firebase Test Lab (for automated testing).

### 📌 Phase 3: UI & User Experience Testing (Before Beta Release)

🔹 **Objective**: Ensure a smooth user experience across devices and OS versions.

✅ **Actions**:

* Perform manual exploratory testing on real devices.
* Automate UI tests using Flutter Driver or Appium.
* Conduct accessibility testing (contrast, screen readers).
* Test dark mode, different screen sizes, and fonts.

📌 **Tools**:

* Appium, Flutter Driver (for automated UI testing).
* BrowserStack, Firebase Test Lab (real device testing).
* Lighthouse (for performance & accessibility testing).

### 📌 Phase 4: Security & Performance Testing (Before Public Launch)

🔹 **Objective**: Ensure the app is secure and performs well under real-world conditions.

✅ **Actions**:

* Perform penetration testing to find security vulnerabilities.
* Test authentication & encryption mechanisms.
* Conduct load testing (simulate high-traffic conditions).
* Monitor memory usage, CPU, and battery consumption.

📌 **Tools**:

* OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite (security testing).
* Firebase Performance Monitoring, JMeter (performance testing).
* Postman + OWASP API Security Testing.

### 📌 Phase 5: Beta Testing & Continuous Monitoring (After Launch)

🔹 **Objective**: Gather real-user feedback and ensure long-term quality.

✅ **Actions**:

* Release a closed beta version (early adopters & businesses).
* Collect user feedback & crash reports (via Firebase Crashlytics).
* Monitor logs & analytics (track API failures, UI freezes).
* Continuously update automated tests for new features.

📌 **Tools**:

* TestFlight (iOS) / Google Play Beta Testing (Android) (for beta distribution).
* Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry (for crash reporting).
* Google Analytics, Mixpanel (for user behavior analysis).

### 🔍 Summary

Testing & QA in mobile development ensures that apps are functional, performant, secure, and user-friendly. It involves different testing phases and best practices to maintain high-quality standards.
