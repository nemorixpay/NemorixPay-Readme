<p align="left"> NemorixPay will be a mobile-first payment solution designed to bring seamless, stable, and efficient transactions to underserved communities in Venezuela and Mexico. Leveraging Stellarâ€™s blockchain, NemorixPay will enable freelancers, small businesses, and content creators to receive payments in USDC, XLM, and other stable assets, bridging the gap between traditional and digital economies.</p>

## :star:Overview of NemorixPay Phase 1

<p align="left">NemorixPay is a mobile-first payment platform designed to facilitate cross-border transactions between the U.S. and Latin America, starting with Mexico and Venezuela. The Phase 1 development focuses on delivering a seamless, secure, and low-cost solution for crypto-based remittances, leveraging blockchain technology to enable instant transactions with minimal fees. The mobile application will support stablecoins like USDC and XLM, providing users with a reliable alternative to traditional remittance services.</p>

### Goals and Scope of the Mobile Application

<p align="left">The primary goal of NemorixPay Phase 1 is to build a functional and user-friendly mobile application that enables:</p>

* **Crypto-to-crypto transactions**: Sending and receiving payments in USDC, XLM, and potentially other stablecoins.
* **Instant and low-cost transfers**: Leveraging the Stellar blockchain networks for fast and inexpensive transactions.
* **Non-custodial wallet support**: Users maintain full control of their funds without reliance on third-party intermediaries.
* **Basic user authentication and security measures**: Ensuring transactions are secure through encryption and authentication protocols.
* **Intuitive UI/UX design**: A mobile-first experience that is simple and accessible for both crypto-savvy users and newcomers.

<p align="left">The scope of Phase 1 is limited to:</p>

* Development of the mobile application for iOS and Android using Flutter.
* Integration with Stellar SDKs for blockchain transactions.
* Secure local storage of transaction history and wallet keys (without storing private keys on servers).
* Basic KYC requirements for initial regulatory compliance is a plus.

<p align="left">Future phases will expand on this foundation by introducing fiat conversion, bank integrations, and additional compliance features.</p>

## :star:Initial Technology Stack

<p align="left">NemorixPayâ€™s mobile application will be built with a modern technology stack optimized for security, scalability, and seamless integration with the Stellar blockchain. The selection of technologies ensures high performance, maintainability, and cross-platform support.</p>

### Core Technologies

* **Programming Language**: Dart
* **Framework**: Flutter (for cross-platform mobile development, Android & iOS)
* **State Management**: BLoC (Business Logic Component)
* **Initial Backend Infrastructure**: Firebase (authentication, database, and cloud functions)
* **Storage**: Secure Storage for sensitive data (e.g., user keys and credentials)
* **Networking**: HTTP & WebSocket for real-time data fetching and transaction updates
* **Cryptography**: Stellar SDK built-in cryptographic tools for signing transactions

### Stellar Blockchain Integration

The mobile app will interact with the Stellar blockchain using the [Stellar Flutter SDK](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk), which provides essential tools for:

* **Account Management** â€“ Creating and managing Stellar accounts.
* **Transaction Handling** â€“ Constructing, signing, and submitting transactions to the Stellar network.
* **Balance & Payment Operations** â€“ Querying balances, sending and receiving payments.
* **Soroban Smart Contracts** â€“ (*Future scope*) Exploring contract deployment on Stellarâ€™s Soroban.

ðŸ“Œ *Additional Notes*: The SDK documentation details [transaction signing and submission](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk/blob/master/soroban.md), ensuring compliance with Stellar's best practices.
