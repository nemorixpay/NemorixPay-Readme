## Overview of NemorixPay Phase 1

<p align="left">NemorixPay is a mobile-first payment platform designed to facilitate cross-border transactions between the U.S. and Latin America, starting with Mexico and Venezuela. The Phase 1 development focuses on delivering a seamless, secure, and low-cost solution for crypto-based remittances, leveraging blockchain technology to enable instant transactions with minimal fees. The mobile application will support stablecoins like USDC and XLM, providing users with a reliable alternative to traditional remittance services.</p>

### Goals and Scope of the Mobile Application

<p align="left">The primary goal of NemorixPay Phase 1 is to build a functional and user-friendly mobile application that enables:</p>

* **Crypto-to-crypto transactions**: Sending and receiving payments in USDC, XLM, and potentially other stablecoins.
* **Instant and low-cost transfers**: Leveraging the Stellar blockchain networks for fast and inexpensive transactions.
* **Non-custodial wallet support**: Users maintain full control of their funds without reliance on third-party intermediaries.
* **Basic user authentication and security measures**: Ensuring transactions are secure through encryption and authentication protocols.
* **Intuitive UI/UX design**: A mobile-first experience that is simple and accessible for both crypto-savvy users and newcomers.

* Development of the mobile application for iOS and Android using Flutter.
* Integration with Stellar SDKs for blockchain transactions.
* Secure local storage of transaction history and wallet keys (without storing private keys on servers).
* Basic KYC requirements for initial regulatory compliance is a plus.
